Build the draft-night dashboard from the downloaded stats.

Run nba_stats_2025_26.py first, then:
    python build_dashboard.py

Reads dashboard_template.html, embeds the player data and writes draft_dashboard.html.
Every player carries his 2023-24, 2024-25 and 2025-26 lines; the page picks the seasons to use,
so rankings, the advanced tab, the team table and the importance panel all follow the season choice.
